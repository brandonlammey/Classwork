Introduction to programming concepts using Java: using classes, defining classes, and extending classes. Introduction to algorithms and data structures useful for problem solving: arrays, lists, files, searching, and sorting.

Labs consist of simple exercises testing our ability to correctly use built-in libraries and apply the basic concepts using algorithms, data structures, and object oriented programming. The homeworks consist of applying methods and classes to solve simple problems and automate routine tasks.
