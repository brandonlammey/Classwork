Programming II - C++ This course used C++ to teach us common data structures, sorting algorithms, basic recursion, pointers, and memory management. We also covered some of the finer points of object oriented programming and did some basic complexity analysis. Each of the labs below was a weekly assignment to reinforce the elcture material. In addition to the topics covered below, we spent some time talking about heaps and array-based trees.



This course continues developing problem solving techniques by focusing on the imperative and object-oriented styles using Abstract Data Types. Basic data structures such as stacks, queues, and trees will be covered. Recursion. Basic notions of algorithmic efficiency and performance analysis in the context of sorting algorithms. Basic Object-Oriented techniques. An associated laboratory will develop projects reinforcing the lecture material. Three class periods and one laboratory period per week.
