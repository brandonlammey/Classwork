#Programming Class Labs

This repository contains programs created for graded coursework and lab assignments. Programs are divided by class, then by assignment

## Programming I (EECS 168)
Problem solving using a high level programming language and object oriented software design. Fundamental stages of software development are discussed: problem specification, program design, implementation, testing, and documentation. Introduction to programming using an object oriented language: using classes, defining classes, and extending classes. Introduction to algorithms and data structures useful for problem solving: arrays, lists, files, searching, and sorting. 

## Programming II (EECS 268)
This course continues developing problem solving techniques by focusing on the imperative and object-oriented styles using Abstract Data Types. Basic data structures such as queues, stacks, trees, and graphs will be covered. Recursion. Basic notions of algorithmic efficiency and performance analysis in the context of sorting algorithms. Basic Object-Oriented techniques.
